# MobileAppCourse_OSU
Repository to hold a few cloud/mobile application projects completed during my Mobile Application course at OSU.

**Android_UI_App**
A simple Android app that has five different activities. The main activity is a list of buttons, each of which will launch a new activity within the app. No real functionality, just a practice in UI design.

**Android_SQLite_and_Location_App**
A mobile application that implements a local android database that text and location information is written to. This application implements permission handling, location access, and database access.

**Android_OAuth_App**
A mobile application using OAuth 2.0. The app allows the posting of simple Google+ Domains text posts via the authenticated user and also displays the three most recent posts made on the user's account.

**Android_Cloud_REST_OAuth_App**
A hybrid project including a REST API back end that is on a live publicly accessible cloud provider with a native mobile front end that interacts with the back end via HTTP calls. The mobile front end uses OAuth 2.0 to allow user accounts. My implementation simulates a "nutrition log", where users can add, delete, and edit their nutritional logs for a day.
